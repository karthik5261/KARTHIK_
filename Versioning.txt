Versioning: 
	Maintaining multiple copies of same object (file, folder or any) is called versioning.

How do we maintain?
	Two ways
	a) Standlone tools
	b) Web

	Ex: TFS[Team foundation server]
	     VSS[Visual Source Safe]
	PVCS [Polytron Version Control System]
	SubVersion
	GitHub 

Github versioning: [ Create an account in github.com and then follow the below process]
	1. We create repository and place all artifacts with appropriate description [remarks]
	2. In case of changes to the artifacts, we should follow the below process.

		a) All objects inside "master" branch, hence create a "child branch". So that all artifacts inside child branch.

		b) Download child branch artifacts, unzip, and modify.

		c) Upload modified to child branch
		d) Request for "PULL" child artifacts to master and go for merge.
		e) Once successfully merge completed, simply drop child branch.
		f) Go to master branch and see the versioning and history of document changes.
